ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Myself Shivam Nirmal, a data scientist who loves exploring and making sense of complex data to solve real-world problems.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing my skills in machine learning, statistical analysis, and programming languages such as Python and R.

ðŸŒ± As a lifelong learner, I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and apply it to real-world situations.

ðŸ’» Check out my GitHub projects, where I've applied my skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization to real-world datasets.
 I enjoy exploring new datasets and developing models that make predictions and recommendations.

ðŸ“« Let's connect! You can find me here on GitHub or on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/ersn. 

I'm excited to bring my skills and passion for data to the right opportunity.
